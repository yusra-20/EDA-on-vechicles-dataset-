# EDA on vechicles dataset
This is beginners friendly Exploratory data analysis project
## Tools Used:    

Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn

## Goal:           

Understand resale car pricing factors through EDA
## INTRODUCTION:

This project explores a dataset of 5,028 used cars to identify the key factors affecting resale value. 
Using Python and visualization techniques, I performed cleaning, univariate, and bivariate analysis to uncover insights.

### Data Cleaning :
Handled missing values by dropping nulls in non-critical columns to maintain accuracy.

### Bivariate Analysis :
Compared selling price with fuel type, transmission, ownership, and year of manufacture.

### Fuel Type :
Diesel cars generally sell at higher prices, while CNG/LPG cars are the lowest valued.

### Transmission :
Automatic cars have higher resale value compared to manual cars.

### Ownership :
First-owner cars are significantly more valuable; price declines with more owners.


## Conclusion :

Car prices are mainly influenced by fuel type, transmission, ownership, and age, while mileage and engine capacity play supporting roles.
